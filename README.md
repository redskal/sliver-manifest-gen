# Sliver Manifest Generator

---

Just a quick, hacky script that generates the manifest.json files for Sliver C2 clients.
This allows you to use your tooling as macros inside the client. I have experienced issues
with some tools that do not work properly as macros; this is mostly due to being unable
to pass CL arguments to the tools - that could just be me, though.

Enjoy
